![Deployment Status](https://argocd.vivaconagua.org/api/badge?name=cert-manager&revision=true)

This repository consists of kubernetes manifests that deploy [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) on our infrastructure the way we want it to.

See the [documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/), specifically [*Securing Ingress Resources*](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/ingress/), on how to issue certificates.
