# Deployment configuration for cert-manager

This repository consists of kubernetes manifests that deploy [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) on our infrastructure the way we want it to.

See the [documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/), specifically [*Securing Ingress Resources*](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/ingress/), on how to issue certificates.
